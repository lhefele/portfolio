## About me

I am a postdoctoral fellow with expertise in infectious disease research, specializing in vaccine-preventable diseases. I have extensive experience in designing and implementing studies in challenging settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. My skills include conducting complex analyses of epidemiological, survey and laboratory data, which contribute to the preparation of comprehensive reports and impactful scientific publications. I am dedicated to advancing public health through evidence-based research.

My research interests encompass infectious diseases, epidemiological methods, immune responses, vaccination strategies, maternal and child health, health disparities and surveillance.
