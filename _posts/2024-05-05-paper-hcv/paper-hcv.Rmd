## Hepatitis C Virus risk factors study in Southern Laos

In a follow-up study conducted in Samuoi district, Saravan province, southern Laos, we investigated the prevalence and risk factors of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Our findings revealed a high seropositivity rate, with 39.8% of participants testing positive for HCV antibodies. Notably, non-sterile medical practices, including the use of re-used syringes (72.5%) and unlicensed parenteral treatments (58%), were common. Tattoos and accidental blood exposure were significantly associated with HCV infection. This study underscores the urgent need for community-wide HCV testing and awareness campaigns to reduce transmission risks. Further viral sequencing is ongoing to enhance our understanding of HCV epidemiology in the region.
