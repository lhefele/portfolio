**Enteric fever**, caused by *Salmonella enterica* serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A, is a significant public health issue, especially in low- and middle-income countries. However, current diagnostic methods often underestimate its true burden. In our latest study, we aimed to explore whether tracking the body's immune response to specific bacterial antigens could help improve how we measure the incidence of enteric fever.

## What We Did
We collected **plasma samples** from patients who were confirmed to have enteric fever via blood cultures, along with febrile patients who tested negative for blood cultures and a group of healthy community members. Using a carefully selected panel of **17 antigens**, we measured the antibody responses over three months through **ELISA** tests.

## What We Found
Interestingly, the immune responses (antibody levels) were mostly similar between all groups for most of the antigens. However, we identified a few key differences:
- Patients with confirmed enteric fever showed **elevated IgG responses** to certain antigens (STY1479/YncE, STY1886/CdtB, STY1498/HlyE, and serovar-specific O2 and O9 antigens) over time compared to controls. This suggested **seroconversion**, a strong sign of exposure to the disease.

## Why It Matters
These findings are exciting because they point to a potential set of antigens that could be used to improve enteric fever **surveillance**. By developing more sensitive and scalable methods, we can better monitor the spread of enteric fever, which could ultimately guide **vaccine policies** and public health interventions.

Our study highlights the importance of continued research into identifying reliable biomarkers for infectious diseases like enteric fever, as it has the potential to lead to more accurate and widespread detection methods.
