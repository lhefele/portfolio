## Highlights

This study uses data from the most recent multiple indicator cluster survey (MICS) which is designed to provide comprehensive data on child and maternal health. The data is nationally representative. We provide relevant information regarding hepatitis B vaccination coverage rates in Laos in children under two years of age and investigated demographic and socioeconomic factors that affect hepatitis B vaccination coverage rates.

## Abstract


**Background**

Within Laos, the vaccination coverage rates with the monovalent hepatitis B birth dose vaccine and hepatitis B antigen-containing combination vaccines remain stagnant with 75% and 64%, respectively, in 2021. In this study, we used data from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys to identify possible factors that represent barriers for receiving these childhood vaccinations.


**Methods**

Data from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys in 2011/12 and 2017 were analysed to examine factors associated with receiving the hepatitis B-containing vaccines using regression modelling. Data analyses were conducted in R.


**Findings**

In 2011/12, the weight-adjusted coverage rate for receiving the hepatitis B birth dose was 48%, while the coverage with the hepatitis B antigen-containing combination vaccine was 55.1% based on both vaccination documents and recall; compared to 69.3% and 59.4% respectively in 2017. Ethno-linguistic group, maternal education, healthcare utilization and wealth were associated with receiving the vaccinations against hepatitis B.


**Interpretation**

National estimates of vaccination coverage rates can conceal country-specific regional or socio-economic variations. Children from Hmong-Mien households, from less wealthier households and whose mothers were less educated and were not able to or did not utilize healthcare were identified as being less likely to receive the vaccinations. These findings indicate the need for improving access to healthcare, in particular for minority groups.
